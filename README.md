# Prose 🧠

**Semantic memory for AI development.**

Prose is a universal semantic memory layer for your AI coding interactions. It extracts decisions, insights, and narrative beats from session logs and evolves them into a persistent, searchable project consciousness.

## ✨ Features

- **Semantic Memory**: Automatically evolves a project-wide record of *why* things were done, not just *what* code changed.
- **Cross-Project Merge**: Seamlessly integrate evolved memory from one project into another—ideal for multi-repo workflows.
- **Digital Archaeology**: Mirror binary session logs into human-readable Markdown for permanent archival.
- **Agent Integration**: Automatically injects project context into `CLAUDE.md` to keep AI agents aligned.
- **Interactive Chronicles**: Browse your development timeline with an interactive web dashboard.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @6digit/prose
```

### Initialize a Project

Run this in your repository root:

```bash
prose init
```

### Evolve Memory

Process your latest sessions and update the project memory:

```bash
prose evolve
```

### Search Memory

Query your project's semantic history:

```bash
prose search "why did we choose the named-branch model?"
```

## 🧬 Core Philosophy

Evolution is a forward move based on the latest delta. Prose doesn't just summarize your history; it uses your previous semantic baseline to evolve your project's understanding with every new interaction.
